# Postgres ETL
    This project consists on putting into practice the following concepts:
    
    - Data modeling with Postgres,
    - Database star schema created,
    - ETL pipeline using Python
## Context
   
    A music company startup wants to analyze the data they havve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. \n",
    Currently, they do not have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
    Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
